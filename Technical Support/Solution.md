# Solution

I joined the `DevSecCon` discord server. I wen to `#devsecops-chat` and it says the following:

```bash
Hey @here and a very warm welcome to all new joiners 👋  Thrilled to have you join us! 
For those of you specifically joining for our upcoming 🚩 Fetch the Flag CTF  🔓, make sure to join ⁠💬・hackers-lounge where all participants can hang out and chat about the CTF Challenges and ⁠🛠・open-help-ticket where you will be able to raise tickets if you need help on the day of the event. 

Also, and ⚠️ Shameless Plus Alert Here ⚠️ , there's more to the DevSecCon Community than just a discord server 😉 We have a bunch of local chapters around the globe 🌎  scheduling events on a regular basis. In those meetups we always have great speakers who share thought leadership and education on AppSec and DevSecOps best practices. 
Feel free to check them out here https://www.meetup.com/pro/devseccon 
```

In the `#open-help-ticket` channel, it says the following:

```bash
Snyk CTF Support ticket
This CTF uses support tickets to help handle requests

If you run into any snags and need a hand or some tech support, here's the deal:

Please avoid DM to the CTF organizers or facilitators. Instead, follow these simple steps:

Kick things off by creating a support ticket with your question.
Don't forget to add some details about the issues you're wrestling with – toss in a code snippet and/or a screenshot. It'll help us help you better! 😉🚀

DO NOT open a ticket if you just need the Technical Support challenge flag. Here it is:

flag{d7aa66ea0edd20221820c84ecc47aee9}
```

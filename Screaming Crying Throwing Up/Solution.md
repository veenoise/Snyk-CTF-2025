# Solution

I searched for xkcd cipher which led me to `https://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/3054:_Scream_Cipher`. Instead of using `cat`, the limited formatting of text in terminal would cut-off some important text-encoding. I used mousepad instead and manually translated the cipher.

So from:

```bash
a̮ăaa̋{áa̲aȧa̮ȧaa̮áa̲a̧ȧȧa̮ȧaa̲a̧aa̮ȧa̲aáa̮a̲aa̲a̮aaa̧}
```

### Answer

```bash
flag{edabfbafedcbbfbadcafbdaefdadfaac}
```
